 * - Lines separated by '\n' are treated as distinct lines.
 * - Empty or whitespace-only lines are ignored.
 *
 * @param {string} currentString - The string or remaining portion of the string to process.
 * @param {string[]} splitLine - An accumulator array holding the processed lines (used internally for recursion).
